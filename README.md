# Nim API Practice

just out here learning nim basics for my own learning and fun.

### Install dependencies with
```bash
nimble install
```

### Run project with
```bash
nim r src/api_practice.nim
```
or
```bash
nimble run
```

both seem to work, not sure which way is "more correct" or if one way even is.

Anyway, have fun playing with it.
